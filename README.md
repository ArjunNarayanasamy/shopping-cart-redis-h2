# shopping-cart-redis-h2

A shopping Cart component, when user choose a product, it will be published to a message queue.

We have micro service component which receives message from message queue, save it into database. 

The code designed with following design constrains in mind:

1. the app should not lose message if the database connections goes down.

2. The app should be able to auto create table if the table doesnâ€™t exist in database.

3. Self-healing from database issue without human intervention.

4. Good fault tolerate

5. should have good test coverage.
